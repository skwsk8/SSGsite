			<h3>History</h3>
			<p>After working in Austin, Texas as a game designer on a several published AAA projects, undisclosed intellectual properties, and mobile games,
			Steve wanted to bring professional game development to Columbus, Ohio, where his family currently resides. He knew his bold and ambitious venture into the independent games space would be challenging
			and require him to learn the new skills necessary to make a game independently. Steve's vision is to build upon success and aims to grow his studio's size and scope.
			This journey, however difficult, would be approached a single step at a time, hence the company was named to reflect that simple yet determined approach.<br><br>
			A major milestone has been reached in this thousand mile journey, the first official release has been achieved! Psyche Soldier VR is now available on Steam for HTC Vive&trade; and Oculus Touch&trade;.</p><br>

			<h2>Psyche Soldier VR</h2>
			<h3>Description</h3>
			<p>What if renowned Psychoanalyst, Carl Jung, were to have made a Virtual Reality game? It would have been something like Psyche Soldier VR.</p>
			<p>Psyche Soldier VR is a challenging, truly dynamic, duck-and-dodge shooting gallery game that takes place in the player's subconscious.
			Players cast light energy to battle against the shadow aspects of their psyche in seven different themed missions: Agency, Attachment, Fear, Procrastination, Shame, Stress, and Perfection. 
			Each mission features unique enemies related to the theme along with a challenging Boss Fight! In addition, there is a Secret Boss Fight!
			There's even a dog you can play fetch with in the menu area, who can also appear as an energy form in the subconscious to save the player from failure.</p>
			<p>Unlike games with a passive shield, the action-based Power Up ability is both defensive and offensive -- surrounding, protecting, increasing damage,
			and strengthening slowing power with the press of a button. Add that to the five Caster abilities, the Spotlight slow, the Energy Collect channel ability, the fluid energy system,
			and the 18 different enemy types, and what you get is an on-the-fly strategic and athletic game that truly uses the dual controller and room scale aspects of VR, making it unlike any other!</p>
			<p>There is an experience-based upgrade system to empower your abilities and chances, and four difficulties to test your skill: Easy, Normal, Mentalist, and Psychonaut.
			There's also an infinite wave Endurance mode with a leaderboard where you can see how deep into your subconscious and how high up the ranks you can go!</p><br>

			<h3>History</h3>
			<p>After experiencing a few virtual reality shooting gallery games that were fun but somehow lacking, Steve saw an opportunity to make a truly dynamic game that delivers physical action,
			on-the-fly strategy, and split targeting. Wanting to expand beyond the 'stand-behind-a-shield-and-spray' playstyle that has dominated most VR shooting gallery games, Steve created a design
			that includes an active power up that is tied to a resource, a large variety of enemies, and completely separate abilities for each of the player's hands. With the gameplay design complete,
			what remained were a setting and story.<br><br>
			When discussing a book, "The Divided Mind" by Dr. John E. Sarno, with a friend, the idea of battling psychic shadows 
			in the subconscious using light and energy brought all of the dynamic elements desired neatly together. With all the elements ready, Steve immediately got started 
			and worked relentlessly until the vision was brought into reality... virtual reality.</p>
			<p>Psyche Soldier VR is available now on Steam for HTC Vive&trade; and Oculus Touch&trade;.</p><br>
